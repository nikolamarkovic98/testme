# testMe
IT Bootcamp Final Project - testMe

testMe is platform where you can create your own tests that other people could try to solve.
It's purpose is to provide education by enabling users to create their own tests and by completing tests from other users.

I developed this application using NodeJS/GraphQL API with MongoDB on the backend and ReactJS on the frontend.

The core features of testMe platform are:
1. SignIn
2. SignUp
3. Creating tests
4. Passing tests
5. Your own profile with created tests and passed tests
6. Search functionality
